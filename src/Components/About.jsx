We make every effort to develop in every child the fear of God, Commitment to the Nation, Wise use of information, Selfless service, Dedication to words duty and thirst for excellence and Wisdom.

While academic progress is clearly the main purpose of the school, we also encourage all our pupils to develop a wide range of additional interests, so that we provide a very rounded and complete education. Most importantly, this takes place in a friendly and caring environment, and the small sizes of our classes and activity groups mean that every studentâ€™s aptitudes are readily identified and developed.</h1>
